# dotNet-DataConvert

Very helpfull class DataConvert contains same methods that is in System.Convert class 
and many other methods which developer would like to have on hand,
like ToNullableInt, ToNullableDateTime, ToNullableGuid, ToNullableEnum<> and more 
those methods works like TryParse but returns null if value can not be converted to specified type

check it out and enjoy ;)
